Introduction: During my time as a secretary to the THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON ECONOMICS,MONETARY,FINANCE, Bangkok,Thailand , the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and I received a task to provide the presentation on the impact of the COVID-19 on gold price and its fundamental analysis. The above picture is the short gold framework analysis that I have presented to the committee. 

**Gold Analysis framework** 

Gold is very unique compared to other financial asset as the asset itself does not generate cash flow and has the cost of carrying.Therefore, the framework are developed in the 4 factors and group according to the short term ( tactical) and log term (strategic)

**Economic Expansion (Strategic Factor)**
THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON ECONOMICS,MONETARY,FINANCE, Bangkok,Thailand
One of the main factor for the gold price valuation is the economic expansion. As the real demand from customer represent around 30% of the total demand (especially from China and India). Therefore, if the world economy is expected to recover and expand , this would support the gold price.

**Risk and Uncertainty (Strategic Factor)**

Gold is used by many asset management firm to hedge against uncertainty and to diversification of their portfolio as the asset has a negative correlation with the stock market. Therefore, the gold price will receive the tail wind support. 

**Opportunity cost (Tactical Factor)**.

Gold does not give any cash flow to the owner; therefore, the interest rate is one of the benchmark of the attractiveness of holding gold relative to other assets. If the interest rate is low, the opportunity cost of holding is low so gold is more attractive. 

**Momentum (Tactical Factor)**

The inflow of the ETF are the short term leading factor of the gold. As more inflow in the ETF will increase the price momentum of the gold price.
