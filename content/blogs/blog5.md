Using the code that Professor Kostis provided in the Data Analytic for Finance course. I am able to create the interactive portfolio chart that can compared return relative to benchmark , CAPM line compared to S&P 500. I will continue to develop and add features to this interactive portfolio website and plan to include the minimum variance portfolio in the future. So please feel free to come and check for the updates of this interactive stock dashboard.
